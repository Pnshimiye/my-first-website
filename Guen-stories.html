  <h2> Guen stuck in a cabinet</h2>
  <p> It was an evening I opened the kitchen cabinet to put some groceries and before I closed it Guen went in. <br>
    The door was half open, so Guen easily got in. the problem was that he didn't want me to know that he was inside.<br>
  so when I came back to put more groceries he hid. <br> 
  Then came a time when he wanted o use his potty. being a very clean cat he wouldn't doanything in the cabinet.<br> so he screamed, and that is
how I got to know where he was</p>
