  <h1>GUEN MY CAT</h1>
  <p>welcome to Guen's page. I decided I will create him some type of journal onlihe.
  <br> he gives me such a good company I find it worth of sharing and I want to keep those good memories</p>

  <h3>here is a number of things that I find special and unique about Guen:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> He is super clean</li>
    <li> He is friendly even to strangers</li>
    <li> He is not a picky eater</li>  
  </ul>
  <p> And.... isn't he cute? :)-:)</p>
